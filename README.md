The University Information System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to provide students, faculty, and staff with easy access to essential university resources. This system streamlines various academic and administrative processes by offering a centralized platform for viewing academic calendars, downloading important documents, and navigating university information.

## Project Description

### Overview

In today's fast-paced educational environment, having an efficient system to manage and disseminate information is crucial. The University Information System addresses this need by integrating multiple functionalities into a single, user-friendly interface. This project includes a collection of HTML pages, Excel spreadsheets, and Word documents that collectively support the day-to-day operations of the university.

### Features

1. **Academic Year Calendar:**

2. **University Web Pages:**
   - The system features several HTML pages that cover various aspects of university life:
     - `homepage.html`: The main entry point of the system, providing an overview and easy navigation to other sections.
     - `academics.html`: Information on academic programs, departments, and faculty.

3. **Forms and Documents:**
   - The system includes essential forms and documents in DOCX format:
