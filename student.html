                    <ol>
                        <li>Prospective students who apply for financial assistance are evaluated according to their high school grades, their national and/or international exam scores, their program choices, and other relevant academic criteria.</li>
                        <li>Qualified applicants are offered partial or full tuition waiver scholarships. Tuition waiver scholarships are awarded at five levels, ranging from 20% to 100% in increments of 20%. Accommodation scholarships may be available for a limited number of top students who are on full tuition waiver scholarship.</li>
                        <li>Students can benefit from tuition waiver scholarships for a maximum of 4 semesters in the English Preparatory Program and for a maximum of 10 semesters in 4-year undergraduate programs. Accommodation scholarships are provided for up to 8 semesters.</li>
                        <li>Students on scholarship are required to take at least the minimum course load from their curriculum specified for their major department each semester (excluding additional courses, any minor program courses, withdrawn courses, GE100, GE251 and non-credit courses) and to maintain a minimum Annual-GPA of 2.00/4.00. English Preparatory Program students are required to qualify to take the ECA or PAE exam at the end of each course or pass PAE by the end of the academic year.</li>
                        <li>Students on accommodation scholarship are required to maintain a minimum Annual-GPA of 2.50/4.00. Students who fail to meet this condition will lose their accommodation scholarship.</li>
                        <li>Attendance to all lectures and academic activities is mandatory for all scholarship students, even if the course instructor does not take formal attendance or specify a minimum level of attendance. In case of poor attendance, scholarships may be temporarily suspended any time.</li>
                        <li>If a scholarship student is subject to disciplinary action, his/her current scholarship may be reduced or cancelled depending on the disciplinary offense and the sanction imposed.</li>
                        <li>Students participated in exchange programs for one or two semesters are required to take and pass a number of courses equal to their minimum course load.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Merit Scholarship</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the end of each academic year, international students who have maintained at least a minimum curriculum course load and achieved an annual GPA of 3.30 or above, as well as ranking in the top 5% of all non-scholarship students in their program, may become eligible for a merit scholarship for the following year. This scholarship is dependent on ranking higher than their current partial tuition waiver.
